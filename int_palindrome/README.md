Intuition

My idea it was to convert the integer into a string and loop from the beginning and the end and the same time.

Approach

I looked for how to convert an integer into a string and found that itoa allowed me to do this. Afterwards I wrote the code to iterate from both the beginning and the end and simultaneously, handling different situations accordingly with the returns.

Complexity

    Time complexity: O(log(num))

    Space complexity: O(log(num))
